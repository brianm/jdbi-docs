title: Getting JDBI
---

JDBI is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) and has no additional runtime dependencies.

# Maven
To make use of JDBI in an [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) based project, add it is a dependency:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jdbi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jdbi</artifactId>
  <version>2.17</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Correct the &lt;version&gt; element to include the version of JDBI you write. The 2.17 version happens to be the most recent version at the time I am writing this documentation.
